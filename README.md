The Open Source app Petals aims to help its users to either quit weed, reduce usage or simply know how much they're
using.

## Building

You can assemble both debug and release versions of the app for different variants (F-Droid, Playstore, GitHub) using
the corresponding Gradle tasks. Here's how to do that:

### Debug Version

- F-Droid: `./gradlew assembleFdroidDebug`
- PlayStore: `./gradlew assemblePlaystoreDebug`
- GitHub: `./gradlew assembleGithubDebug`

### Release Version

For the release version, you must first decrypt secrets using `git secret reveal`. The release version can be assembled
as follows:

- F-Droid: `./gradlew assembleFdroidRelease`
- PlayStore: `./gradlew assemblePlaystoreRelease`
- GitHub: `./gradlew assembleGithubRelease`

## Quality

Both badges above link to the workflow that produces them. Coverage is measured on every push to
`main`; mutation testing runs weekly, or on demand from the Actions tab.

### Coverage

[Kover](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover) measures line coverage of the JVM unit tests.
Composables, generated SQLDelight code, `BuildConfig` and library code Kotlin inlined into our
classes are excluded, since none of them are exercised by unit tests or ours to test.

- `./gradlew koverHtmlReport` writes a browsable report to `app/build/reports/kover/html`
- `./gradlew printLineCoverage` prints the single number the badge is built from

### Mutation Testing

Coverage says a line ran; it does not say a test would notice if the line were wrong.
[PIT](https://pitest.org) answers that by changing the compiled bytecode and checking whether the
suite fails. A surviving mutant is a line no assertion cares about.

PIT runs the Kotest engine directly through `kotest-extensions-pitest` and is scoped to the
`fdroidDebug` variant, with the same exclusions Kover uses.

- `./gradlew pitest` writes a report to `app/build/reports/pitest/index.html`
- `./gradlew printTestStrength` prints the single number the badge is built from
- `./gradlew printMutationScore` prints the same thing counting untested code too

The badge reports **test strength**, not the raw mutation score: of the mutants a test actually
executed, how many did it catch. Mutants in code no test reaches are left out on purpose, because
that gap is what the Coverage badge next to it already measures. A low mutation score beside a high
test strength means untested code; a low test strength means the tests that exist do not assert
enough.

A full run takes around 13 minutes, so it is scheduled weekly rather than run per merge, and is
never part of the pull request checks.

Specs must be named `*Test`: PIT is pointed at that glob, and a spec named anything else would be
skipped without failing anything. `verifySpecNaming` enforces it as part of the `pitest` task.

## Git Secrets

The **Keystore**, **Keystore Properties**, and **Google Play deploy json** files are included in the repository using
[git secret](https://sobolevn.me/git-secret/). The current secret owners are:

- Leonardo Colman Lopes
    - Fingerprint `B3A5 9909 9ECC 4DB4 FD40 896F 7706 1922 C587 2792`
    - Original Author

- GitHub Actions
    - Fingerprint `882E 409C 71F4 565B 1698 B947 A992 5FF4 75B3 5E07`
    - Auto-publishing signed app to GitHub
    - Expires on 2027-04-05
    - Available on environment secret `GPG_KEY`

## Releasing

Release to all our channels is made automatically after a tag is released. The workflow responsible for doing this
is [release.main.kts](.github/workflows/release.main.kts).

### Google Play Store

1. Decrypt all git secrets
2. Run `./gradlew bundlePlaystoreRelease`
3. Publish to playstore by running
   `cd fastlane && bundle config path vendor/bundle && bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3 && bundle exec fastlane playstore`

### F-Droid

F-Droid builds automatically from the repository whenever a new tag is published. The definitions for how to build the
app are
in [F-Droid's data repository](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/br.com.colman.petals.yml). If
modifications are required, the place to change is there.

### Releases Page

1. Decrypt all git secrets
2. Run `./gradlew assembleGithubRelease`
